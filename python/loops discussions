/*The criteria is:

Read an integer N. For all non-negative integers i < N, print i^2. Constraints: 1 <= N <= 20

To put it into simpler terms:

I want a program that will take any number that is between 0 & 21. From there I want the program to print out every value starting with 0 multiplied with itself. For example if I give you the number 5, the program should print out:

0
1
4
9
16
The output of the program can be interpreted as such:*/

0 x 0 = 0
1 x 1 = 1
2 x 2 = 4
3 x 3 = 9
4 x 4 = 16










n = int(input())
i=0
for i in range(n): 
    print(i*i)
